3. If there are private matters specific to you (e.g special accommodations, requesting alternative arrangements etc.), please create a private post on Piazza.
4. For longer discussions (e.g., help on R project), please come to office hours. 
5. I will respond to Piazza posts sent during the week within 24h. I will respond to Piazza posts sent during the weekend at my own discretion.

### Course materials
#### Textbook
Finding a good book is always a problem—none of the available texts is fully satisfactory. I will mostly follow the chapters in

[*Introduction to Statistics and Data Science: A moderndive into R and the tidyverse*](https://nulib.github.io/moderndive_book/index.html) 

by Chester Ismay, Albert Y. Kim, Arend M. Kuyper, Elizabeth Tipton, and Kaitlyn G. Fitzgerald. But we shall also read widely from various sources. I will occasionally post additional reading materials. Please check the daily schedule for reading assignments each day.

#### Computer and zoom attendance

You are not required to purchase any books, hardware, or software for this course. While not required, having one’s own laptop (and webcam, if not built-in) is helpful, particularly for in-class activities and office hours.  If you do not have a laptop, please reach out to me at the beginning of the module to discuss possibilities.

Students should ideally be attending the class via zoom with webcam enabled and microphone capability, unless simply not possible, to maximize opportunities for participation. If you do not have stable internet or webcam, please let me know at the beginning of the module. 

#### R and Rstudio

We will be using the programming language R and Rstudio. R is one of the most commonly used programming languages in academic research and industry. Knowing R is a marketable skill. In this class, you will learn enough about R to conduct basic data analysis tasks. Please install [R](https://cran.r-project.org) and [Rstudio](https://cran.r-project.org) at your earliest convenience.
