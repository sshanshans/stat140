### Computing
We will be using the programming language R and [RStudio](https://rstudio.cloud). 

R is one of the most commonly used programming languages in academic research and industry. Knowing R is a marketable skill. In this class, you will learn enough about R to conduct basic data analysis tasks.

### Class format
This course will use the **flipped classroom** model. That means,

* Before each lecture, you will be learning the content through assigned readings, videos or recorded lectures, and completing a readiness assessment quiz 
* During the lecture, you will be working on an interactive tutorial to enhance your learning. The purpose of the tutorial is to give you immediate feedback during the process of mastering a new concept or skill set
* After the lecture, you will be preparing for the next lecture, and occasionally completing an evaluative assignment. 

### Where to find help
General questions about course content or assignments should be posted on [Piazza](https://piazza.com), since there are likely other students in the class with similar questions. Questions about grades or personal matters should be emailed directly to Professor Shan Shan.

The teaching team is here to help you be successful in the course. You are encouraged to attend the office hours for help with the course content and/or assignments. 

### Where to find course materials
All course materials can be found on [Moodle](https://moodle.mtholyoke.edu/course/view.php?id=19041). In particular, all assignments will be distributed, submitted and returned via Moodle.

### Cultivate a community of learning
This upcoming semester will be unlike any other in the history of Mount Holyoke. The Covid-19 virus has caused unprecedented challenges and distruptions in our life, nearby campus or the world. We are engaged in what may be the greatest experiment in the history of higher education. As an instructor, I am grateful to you and your classmates for your flexibility as we transition to new models of teaching, and I am committed to doing my very best to make your learning experience exceptional. 

*  #### Your health and well-being (adpated from Prof. Anupam Gupta)
One major goal is that you will have fun taking this course and learning the new cool material, as much as I hope to have fun teaching it. Part of making sure you have fun involves taking care of yourself, especially during the time of an ongoing pandemic. Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, maintainging a phyical distance of 6 feet, washing your hands often, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress. If you are on campus and experiencing symptoms of COVID-19, contact Health Services immediately for help. 

*  #### Stay engaged in the course
Your active engagement in the course is crucial to your learning.  Here are multiple pathways for you to stay engaged: 
    * Asking questions in class and on Piazza: Questions are a normal part of the process of learning.
    * Answersing questions in class and on Piazza: Don't worry if you got the answer wrong. Mistakes are valuable. You learn and improve each time you fix your mistakes.
    * Coming to Zoom office hours: I will try to make sure everyone in the course can at least attend one office hour every week. 

*  #### Stay connected with each other
Mount Holyoke is no common community. We are wired to be caring for one another.  In this course, you are encouraged to work with others and learn from each other. 
    * In class, you will be working in pairs of two partners in a zoom break-out room: each of you will write your own assignment, but talk with each other throughout. You will work with a different partner every class. 
    * (Quoted from David Kane) If you are the stronger student in the pair, do not simply charge ahead. Instead, make sure that your partner keeps up with you. If you aren't talking with each other often, then you are doing it wrong. *There is no better way to learn than to teach*.
    * (Adpated from Tian Zhang) In group evaluative assignment, you will be asked to work in groups of three partners. Be a good team member and contribute to each project as much as you can. Don't underestimate the efforts of your teammates. Something seems simple may not be that simple. Working towards deadlines can be stressful. Remember, emails or online posts do NOT have tones. Be mindful about how you phrase your questions, comments, inquries, and suggestions. Also be generous and forgiving when reading them.
