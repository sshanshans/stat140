### Computing
We will be using the programming language R and [RStudio](https://rstudio.cloud). 

R is one of the most commonly used programming languages in academic research and industry. Knowing R is a marketable skill. In this class, you will learn enough about R to conduct basic data analysis tasks.

### Class format
This course will use the **flipped classroom** model. That means,

* Before each lecture, you will be learning the content through assigned readings, videos or recorded lectures, and completing a quiz 
* During the lecture, you will be working on an interactive tutorial in groups to enhance your learning. The purpose of the tutorial is to give you immediate feedback during the process of mastering a new concept or skill set. This portion will be synchronous, online and recorded. 
* After the lecture, you will be preparing for the next lecture, and occasionally completing an evaluative assignment. 

### Where to find help
General questions about course content or assignments should be posted on [Piazza](https://piazza.com), since there are likely other students in the class with similar questions. Questions about grades or personal matters should be emailed directly to Professor Shan Shan.

The teaching team is here to help you be successful in the course. You are encouraged to attend the office hours for help with the course content and/or assignments. 

### Where to find course materials
All course materials can be found on [Moodle](https://moodle.mtholyoke.edu/course/view.php?id=19041). In particular, all assignments will be distributed, submitted and returned via Moodle.

### Cultivate a community of learning
This upcoming semester will be unlike any other in the history of Mount Holyoke. The Covid-19 has caused unprecedented challenges and distruptions in our life, nearby campus or the world. We are engaged in what may be the greatest experiment in the history of higher education. As an instructor, I am grateful to you and your classmates for your flexibility as we transition to new models of teaching, and I am committed to doing my very best to make your learning experience exceptional. 

*  #### Your health and well-being
Part of making sure you have an engagin learning experience involves taking care of yourself, especially during the time of an ongoing pandemic. Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, maintainging a phyical distance of 6 feet, washing your hands often, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress. If you are on campus and experiencing symptoms of COVID-19, contact Health Services immediately for help. 

*  #### Stay engaged in the course
Your active engagement in the course is crucial to your learning.  Here are multiple pathways for you to stay engaged: 
    * Asking questions in class and on Piazza: Questions are a normal part of the process of learning.
    * Answersing questions in class and on Piazza: Don't worry if you got the answer wrong. Mistakes are valuable. You learn and improve each time you fix your mistakes.
    * Coming to Zoom office hours or open space office hours (if you can): I will try to make sure everyone in the course can at least attend one office hour every week. 

*  #### Stay connected with each other
Mount Holyoke is no common community. We are wired to be caring for others.  Let's all make the efforts to create a welcoming learning environment for everyone. For example, 
   * When doing group projects, consider inviting those who won't be able to come to campus or even locate in a different time zone. 
   * Working towards deadlines can be stressful. Remember, emails or online posts do NOT have tones. Be mindful about how you phrase your questions, comments, inquries, and suggestions. Also be generous and forgiving when reading them.
