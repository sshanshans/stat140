### Computing
We will be using the programming language R and [RStudio](https://rstudio.cloud). 

R is one of the most commonly used programming languages in academic research and industry, and I use it daily. Knowing R is a marketable skill. In this class, you will learn enough about R to conduct basic data analysis tasks.

### Class format
* This course will use the **flipped classroom** model. That means,

    * Before each lecture, you will be learning the content through assigned readings, videos or recorded lectures, and completing a readiness assessment quiz; 
    
    * During the lecture, you will be working on an interactive tutorial to enhance your learning. The purpose of the tutorial is to give you immediate feedback during the process of mastering a new concept or skill set;
    
    * After the lecture, you will be completing an evaluative assignment and prepare for the next lecture.

* The assignments in this class follow a **mastery learning** model. That means,

    * You must demonstrate mastery of one assignment by scoring sufficiently highly before you may start on the next assignment.
    
    * You are allowed to resubmit your assignment multiple times, fix your mistakes, and improve your scores.

### Where to find help
General questions about course content or assignments should be posted on [Piazza](https://piazza.com), since there are likely other students in the class with similar questions. Questions about grades or personal matters should be emailed directly to Professor Shan Shan.

The teaching team is here to help you be successful in the course. You are encouraged to attend any of the office hours posted on the home page for help with the course content and/or assignments. 

### Where to find course materials
All course materials may be found on the [course website] (https://sshanshans.github.io/stat140/). There is also an up-to-date [course schedule](https://sshanshans.github.io/stat140/schedule.html) where you can find the agenda in each class meeting.

Announcements may also be sent to the class by email, so please check your mount holyoke email regularly. 

### Where to submit your assignments
All assignments should be submitted through [Moodle](https://moodle.mtholyoke.edu).

### Cultivate a community of learning
* Everyone can learn statistics and programming at a high level.
* Mistakes are valuable.
* Questions are a normal part of the process of learning.
* Class is about learning, not performing.
* Depth is more important than speed.
