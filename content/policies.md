### Inclusion & Accessibility
This course is designed to be welcoming and accessible to all students. 
It is my goal for our learning environment to facilitate learning and intellectual development for **everyone**. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, or if there is some aspect of class that is not welcoming or accessible to you, please let me know immediately. 

* #### Academic Accommodations
AccessAbility Services is the office on campus that determines academic accommodations for students with disabilities. If you need official accommodations through AccessAbility Services, you have a right to have these met and kept confidential. Please contact AccessAbility Services, located in Mary Lyon Hall 3rd Floor, at 413-538-2634 or accessability-services@mtholyoke.edu. If you are eligible for academic accommodations, you will be provided with an accommodation letter. Once you receive your accommodation letter, I would like to meet with you and discuss these approved accommodations and our class. For more information on who might be eligible for accommodations and the application process please see the [AccessAbility Services website](www.mtholyoke.edu/accessability).

* #### Religious Accomodations
In support of our religiously diverse student population, students may miss a class, obtain an extension on an assignment, or reschedule an exam if there is a conflict with a religious high holiday or observance. Students should notify me at the beginning of the module if a religious observance will require special accommodation.

* #### Other Accomodations 
If you have any needs that require accommodation, e.g., a personal or family emergency or health condition that affects your ability to participate in class, please feel free to talk with me.

### Activities & Assessments
The following activities and assessments will help you successfully achieve the course learning objectives. By experiencing the course content in different ways, you will not only gain a better understanding of statistics, but you will also get experiences that can guide you as you apply what you've learned in future academic and professional projects.

<br>

#### Formative assignments (%)
The formative assignments, including quizzes and tutorials, are designed to enhance your understanding of the materials through small analysis and computational tasks. The formative assignments are implemetned with autograding features to give you immediate feedback; you are allowed to answer a question multiple times, fixing your mistakes and learning from them each time. All formative asignments will be graded based on Pass/Fail (0 point for fail and 1 point for pass), and you must get all answers correct in the assignment in order to pass.

<br>

* ####  Quizzes (%)
The quizzes will be completed online before each class. Each quiz is worth 1 point. Once you passed the quiz, take a screenshot and upload the screenshot image on Moodle. 
<br> 
<br>

* #### Tutorials (%)
In the tutorials, you will apply the concepts you learned to complete data analysis tasks. Click [here] for an example. 
Class time will be dedicated for you to complete these exercises. Each tutorial is worth 1 point. When doing these tutorials, you may ask me and TAs for help. Once you passed the tutorial, take a screenshot and upload the screenshot image on Moodle. 

* #### Late policy
While you are expected to finish these assignments before 5PM (EST) in each class, we recognize that sometimes you must be absent for legitimate reasons and that sometimes the assignments take longer than expected. Each formative assignment will have a one-day grace period: an assignment is considered late at 5PM (EST) the next day. For example, a quiz is due Aug 24, 2020 @ 5PM (EST), it will be considered late if you submit on Moodle after Aug 25, 2020 @5PM (EST). Once an assignment is late, it will start to lose points. In particular, your grade (G) 
is computed with a logistic function of the number of hours (H) that your assignment is late:
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?&space; G = 2/ (1 + \exp^{H}). " title="G = 2/ (1 + \exp^{H})" /> Note that this means <1 hour = 0.979, 2 hours = 0.958, 3 hours = 0.938, 1 days = 0.5379, 2 days = 0.2384, etc.
<br> 
<br>

#### Evaluative assignments (%)

The evaluative assignments are an opportunity to assess the knowledge and skills you’ve learned. Typically, you will get one evaluative assignment each week. These assignments may be in the format of, e.g., Rstudio lab report, reading response, news critics, midterm exam, poster or oral presentation. More details about the content and structure of these assignments will be included in the future.

The final grade will be calculated as follows:

-----------|---------------------------------
Readiness quizzes | %
Tutorial exercises | %
Evaluative assignments | %

Grades may be curved at the end of the semester. Cumulative numerical averages of 90 - 100 are guaranteed at least an A-, 80 - 89 at least a B-, and 70 - 79 at least a C-, however the exact ranges for letter grades will be determined after the final exam. The more evidence there is that the class has mastered the material, the more generous the curve will be.
