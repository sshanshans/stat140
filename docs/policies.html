<li>
<h4 id="textbook">Textbook</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Finding a good book is always a problem&mdash;none of the available texts is fully satisfactory.
I will mostly follow the chapters in</p>
<p><a href="https://nulib.github.io/moderndive_book/index.html"><em>Introduction to Statistics and Data Science: A moderndive into R and the tidyverse</em></a></p>
<p>by Chester Ismay, Albert Y. Kim, Arend M. Kuyper, Elizabeth Tipton, and Kaitlyn G. Fitzgerald. But we shall also read widely from various sources. I will occasionally post additional reading materials. Please check the daily schedule for reading assignments each day.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4 id="computer-and-zoom-attendance">Computer and zoom attendance</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You are not required to purchase any books, hardware, or software for this course. While not required, having one’s own laptop (and webcam, if not built-in) is helpful, particularly for in-class activities and office hours.  If you do not have a laptop, please reach out to me at the beginning of the module to discuss possibilities.</p>
<p>Students should ideally be attending the class via zoom with webcam enabled and microphone capability, unless simply not possible, to maximize opportunities for participation. If you do not have stable internet or webcam, please let me know at the beginning of the module.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4 id="r-and-rstudio">R and Rstudio</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We will be using the programming language R and Rstudio. R is one of the most commonly used programming languages in academic research and industry. Knowing R is a marketable skill. In this class, you will learn enough about R to conduct basic data analysis tasks.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<h4 id="weekly-problem-set">Weekly problem set</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The weekly problem sets are designed to enhance your understanding of the materials through multiple small statistical analysis and computational tasks. These assignments are graded based on individual efforts &ndash; you are encouraged to work with others in the class, but your writing-up must be your own.

<ul>
<li>
<h4 id="mini-projects">Mini-projects</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the mini-projects, you will apply the concepts you learned to complete data analysis tasks. You will get one mini-project each week during the first three weeks.</p>
<ul>
<li>MP 01 (5%) will get you up to speed with Rstudio and Rmarkdown document</li>
<li>MP 02 (10%) will horn your skills in data visualization and summaries</li>
<li>MP 03 (15%) will showcase your data modeling skills</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>You will be <strong>assigned</strong> to a different group each week for completing these miniprojects.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4 id="final-project">Final project</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The final group project spans over the last four weeks. You will do analysis on a dataset of your own choosing. The goal of this project is for you to demonstrate proficiency in the techniques we have covered in this class (and beyond, if you like) and apply them to a dataset in a meaningful way. You will begin with (1) finding a dataset and research question on your own (2) writing a project proposal with exploratory data analysis (3) and presenting your proposal at the grant panel on Nov 23 and Nov 24.  Among all your submission, 25% of the projects will be selected to proceed onto the next stage. You will form a group based on your interest in the selected projects and work with each other to create a final report and presentation.</p>
<ul>
<li>FP 01: Project proposal (15%)</li>
<li>FP 02: Proposal presentation (5%)</li>
<li>FP 03: final report (10%)</li>
<li>FP 04: final presentation (10%)</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that you are responsible for forming your own group in the final project. There will a post on Piazza for finding a team. If you still need help find a group, or a group member, just let me know.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<ul>
<li>
<h4 id="participation">Participation</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are several ways for you to get the participation points.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Coming to class on time and be ready to learn.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take an active role in your group discussion. There are in general four roles in each group:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scriber: taking notes on Googlesheet or Piazza to keep track of your group&rsquo;s process,</li>
<li>Manager: leading the discussion and making sure the group is completing the activity on time.</li>
<li>Spokesperson: communicating the results to others, e.g., speaking in class, pinning the instructor for help, etc.</li>
<li>Editor: edit the notes/posts by the scriber</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Helping your fellow students, especially on Piazza, also counts towards participation. If there were no questions, share interesting findings or news related to the course materials on Piazza is also volunteering for a class role.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note:  If there is a significant time difference that prevents you from joining the synchronous portion of the course, I might be able to &ndash; though not guaranteed &ndash; set up a study group for you with those in the same time zone. Joining the study group will be counted as participation.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4 id="late-policy">Late Policy</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All the due dates can be found on the schedule page. If late but within 1 hour of due time, 3% of the assignment grade will be subtracted; if late but within 24 hours, 20% of the assignment grade will be subtracted. Any later will receive no credit, unless there is a pre-arrangement agreed by me. Be sure to turn in your work early to avoid any technological mishaps. There is no late work accepted for FP02 and FP04.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4 id="final-grade-calculation">Final grade calculation</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The final grade will be calculated as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Individual-based work (50%)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Weekly homework + Datacamp (25%)</li>
<li>FP01, FP02 (20%)</li>
<li>Participation (5%)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Group-based work (50%)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Miniprojects (30%)</li>
<li>FP03, FP04 (20%)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Cumulative numerical averages of 90 - 100 are guaranteed at least an A-, 80 - 89 at least a B-, and 70 - 79 at least a C-, however the exact ranges for letter grades will be determined after the final exam period.</p>

    	Cultivate a community of learning
    	
    </summary>
    <div class="markdown-inner">
	<br>
    	<p>This upcoming semester will be unlike any other in the history of Mount Holyoke. The Covid-19 has caused unprecedented challenges and disruptions in our life, nearby campus or the world. We are engaged in what may be the greatest experiment in the history of higher education. As an instructor, I am grateful to you and your classmates for your flexibility as we transition to new models of teaching, and I am committed to doing my very best to make your learning experience exceptional.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4 id="your-health-and-well-being">Your health and well-being</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Part of making sure you have an engaging learning experience involves taking care of yourself, especially during the time of an ongoing pandemic. Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, maintaining a physical distance of 6 feet, washing your hands often, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress. If you are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19, contact your closest health services immediately for help and reach out to me to discuss accommodations for you to take this course. If you experience significant stress or worry, changes in mood, or problems eating or sleeping this semester, whether because of Stat140 or other courses or factors, please do not hesitate to reach out immediately to me to discuss. Everyone can benefit from support during challenging times. Not only are we happy to listen and make accommodations with deadlines as needed, we can also refer you to additional support structures.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4 id="stay-engaged-in-the-course">Stay engaged in the course</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Your active engagement in the course is crucial to your learning.  Here are multiple pathways for you to stay engaged.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Asking questions in class and on Piazza: Questions are a normal part of the process of learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Answering questions in class and on Piazza: Don&rsquo;t worry if you got the answer wrong. Mistakes are valuable. You learn and improve each time you fix your mistakes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coming to Zoom office hours</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4 id="stay-connected-with-each-other">Stay connected with each other</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Mount Holyoke is no common community. We are wired to be caring for others.  Let&rsquo;s all make efforts towards creating a welcoming learning environment for everyone. For example,</p>
<ul>
<li>When doing group projects, consider inviting those locate in a different time zone.</li>
<li>Working towards deadlines can be stressful. Be mindful about how you phrase your questions, comments, inquiries, and suggestions. Also be generous and forgiving when reading them.</li>
