	            <h3 id="inclusion--accessibility">Inclusion &amp; Accessibility</h3>

<p>This course is designed to be welcoming and accessible to all students.
It is my goal for our learning environment to facilitate learning and intellectual development for <strong>everyone</strong>. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, or if there is some aspect of class that is not welcoming or accessible to you, please let me know immediately.</p>

<ul>
<li><h4 id="academic-accommodations">Academic Accommodations</h4>

<p>AccessAbility Services is the office on campus that determines academic accommodations for students with disabilities. If you need official accommodations through AccessAbility Services, you have a right to have these met and kept confidential. Please contact AccessAbility Services, located in Mary Lyon Hall 3rd Floor, at 413-538-2634 or accessability-services@mtholyoke.edu. If you are eligible for academic accommodations, you will be provided with an accommodation letter. Once you receive your accommodation letter, I would like to meet with you and discuss these approved accommodations and our class. For more information on who might be eligible for accommodations and the application process please see the <a href="www.mtholyoke.edu/accessability">AccessAbility Services website</a>.</p></li>

<li><h4 id="religious-accommodations">Religious Accommodations</h4>

<p>In support of our religiously diverse student population, students may miss a class, obtain an extension on an assignment, or reschedule an exam if there is a conflict with a religious high holiday or observance. Students should notify me at the beginning of the module if a religious observance will require special accommodation.</p></li>

<li><h4 id="other-accommodations">Other Accommodations</h4>

<p>If you have any needs that require accommodation, e.g., a personal or family emergency or health condition that affects your ability to participate in class, please feel free to talk with me.
<br>
<br></p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="activities--assessments">Activities &amp; Assessments</h3>

<p>The following activities and assessments will help you successfully achieve the course learning objectives. By experiencing the course content in different ways, you will not only gain a better understanding of statistics, but you will also get experiences that can guide you as you apply what you've learned in future academic and professional projects.
<br>
<br></p>

<h4 id="formative-assignments-30">Formative assignments (30%)</h4>

<p>The formative assignments, including quizzes and tutorials, are designed to enhance your understanding of the materials through small analysis and computational tasks. The formative assignments are implemented with auto-grading features to give you immediate feedback; you are allowed to answer a question multiple times, fixing your mistakes and learning from them each time. All formative assignments will be graded based on Pass/Fail (0 point for fail and 1 point for pass), and you must get all answers correct in the assignment in order to pass.
<br>
<br></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Quizzes</strong>
The quizzes will be completed online before each class. Each quiz is worth 1 point. Once you passed the quiz, take a screenshot and upload the screenshot image on Moodle.
<br>
<br></p></li>

<li><p><strong>DataCamp</strong>
In the first two weeks, you will be asked to complete DataCamp assignment from the <code>Introduction to R course</code>, and <code>Introduction to Tidyverse</code> course.  You will get an email by the first day of class inviting you to join our class organization with an assignment pointing you to the specific chapters to do. The DataCamp assignment is graded based on completion. Each assignment is worth 1 point.
<br>
<br></p></li>

<li><p><strong>Tutorials</strong>
In the tutorials, you will apply the concepts you learned to complete data analysis tasks. Click <a href="http://138.110.84.108:3838/sshan/tutorials/unit1/">here</a> for an example (You need to first connect to the MHC VPN). Each tutorial is worth 1 point. Class time will be dedicated for you to complete these exercises. In class, you will be working in groups of three or four in a zoom break-out room, but each of you will write your own assignment. When doing these tutorials, it's important for you to talk with each other throughout. If you are the stronger student in the group, do not simply charge ahead. Instead, make sure that your group members keep up with you. <em>There is no better way to learn than to teach</em>. If you get stuck, you may ask me and TAs for help.
<br>
<br></p></li>

<li><p><strong>Late policy</strong>
While you are expected to finish these assignments before 6PM (EST) in each class, we recognize that sometimes you must be absent for legitimate reasons and that sometimes the assignments take longer than expected. Each formative assignment will have a one-day grace period: an assignment is considered late at 6PM (EST) the next day. For example, a quiz is due Aug 24, 2020 @ 6PM (EST), it will be considered late if you submit on Moodle after Aug 25, 2020 @6PM (EST). Once an assignment is late, it will start to lose points. In particular, your grade (G)
is computed with a logistic function of the number of hours (H) that your assignment is late:
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?&space; G = 2/ (1 + \exp^{H}). " title="G = 2/ (1 + \exp^{H})" /> Note that this means <1 hour = 0.979, 2 hours = 0.958, 3 hours = 0.938, 1 days = 0.5379, 2 days = 0.2384, etc.
<br>
<br></p></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="evaluative-assignments-60">Evaluative assignments (60%)</h4>

<p>The evaluative assignments are an opportunity to assess the knowledge and skills you’ve learned. Typically, you will get one evaluative assignment each week. The first three evaluative assignments (EA01-03) are mini-projects that will build up the muscles and skills for you to complete the final group project (EA04-07). Remeber the goal of this course is to enable <em>you</em> to tell a story with data in as faithful a manner as possible.</p>

<p>Note that in all group projects, you are responsible for forming your own group. If you need help find a group, or a group member, just let me know.
<br>
<br></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Mini-projects (30%)</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>EA 01 (5%) is individual work that will get you up to speed with Rstudio and Rmarkdown document</li>
<li>EA 02 (10%) is a group project that will horn your skills in data visualization and summries</li>
<li>EA 03 (15%) is a group project that will showcase your data modeling skills
<br>
<br></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p><strong>Final group project (30%)</strong>
The final group project spans over four evaluative assignments (EA04-07). In groups of 2-3 students, you will do analysis on a dataset of your own choosing. The goal of this project is for you to demonstrate proficiency in the techniques we have covered in this class (and beyond, if you like) and apply them to a dataset in a meaningful way.</p>

<ul>
<li>EA 04 (10%): form a group and propose a project</li>
<li>EA 05 (10%): preliminary analysis</li>
<li>EA 06 (5%): final report</li>
<li>EA 07 (5%): final presentation
<br>
<br></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p><strong>Late policy</strong>
There is no late work accepted on evaluative assignments, unless there is a pre-arrangement agreed by me. Be sure to turn in your work early to avoid any technological mishaps.
<br>
<br></p></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="participation-10">Participation (10%)</h4>

<p>There are in general two ways for you to get the participation points. You will earn up to 1 point for each class.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Group participation:
Coming to class will automatically give you 0.5 point for participation. To increase your point, you can try to take an active role in your group discussion. There are three roles in each group:</p>

<ul>
<li>role A: taking notes in a Google doc (shared by the instructor) to keep track of your group's process,</li>
<li>role B: leading the discussion and making sure everyone understand what they are doing</li>
<li>role C: communicating the results to others, e.g. posting results on Piazza, speaking in class, etc.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>Solo participation:
I understand that sometimes you won't be able to participate class activities for legitimate reasons (e.g. being sick, time difference, etc). Helping your fellow students, especially on Piazza, also counts towards participation. If there were no questions, share interesting findings or news related to the course materials on Piazza is also volunteering for a class role.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Note:  If there is a significant time difference that prevents you from joining the synchronous portion of the course, I might be able to -- though not guaranteed -- set up a study group for you with those in the similar time zones. Joining the study group will be counted as group participation.</p>

<h4 id="grade-calculation-">Grade Calculation (%)</h4>

<p>The final grade will be calculated as follows:</p>

<table class="table table-condensed table-striped table2 text-left">
<thead>
<tr>
<th><span></span></th>
<th><span></span></th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Formative assignments</td>
<td>30%</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Evaluative assignments</td>
<td>60%</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Participation</td>
<td>10%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Cumulative numerical averages of 90 - 100 are guaranteed at least an A-, 80 - 89 at least a B-, and 70 - 79 at least a C-, however the exact ranges for letter grades will be determined after the final exam.</p>
