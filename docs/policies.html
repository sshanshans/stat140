	            <h3 id="activities--assessments">Activities &amp; Assessments</h3>

<p>The following activities and assessments will help you successfully achieve the course learning objectives. By experiencing the course content in different ways, you will not only gain a better understanding of data science, but you will also get experiences that can guide you as you apply what you've learned in future academic and professional projects.
<br>
<br></p>

<h4 id="homework-20">Homework (20%)</h4>

<p>In homework, you will apply what you've learned during lecture and lab to complete data analysis tasks. You may discuss homework assignments with other students; however, homework should be completed and submitted individually. Homework must be typed up using R Markdown and submitted in the appropriate GitHub repository.</p>

<p><em>The lowest homework grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.</em>
<br>
<br></p>

<h4 id="labs-15">Labs (15%)</h4>

<p>In labs, you will apply the concepts discussed in lecture to various data analysis scenarios, with a focus on the computation. You will work on lab assignments in teams, and all team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of each assignment. You are expected to use the team's Git repository on the course's GitHub page as as the central platform for collaboration. Commits to this repository will be used as a metric of each team member's relative contribution for each lab. You will also be asked to evaluate your team members' performance periodically during the semester.</p>

<p><em>The lowest lab grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.</em>
<br>
<br></p>

<h4 id="exams-exam-1-175-exam-2-175">Exams (Exam 1: 17.5%, Exam 2: 17.5%)</h4>

<p>The exams are an opportunity to assess the knowledge and skills you’ve learned. Both exams will be take-home assignments that you are expected to complete individually.  Each exam will include small analysis and computational tasks related to the content discussed in lectures, application exercises, homework assignments, and labs. More details about the content and structure of the exams will be discussed during the semester.
<br>
<br></p>

<h4 id="final-project-15">Final Project (15%)</h4>

<p>The purpose of the project is to apply what you’ve learned throughout the semester to analyze an interesting data-based research question. The project will be completed in teams, and each team will present their results during the final exam period, Monday, April 29, 2p - 5p. <em>You must complete the final project and present your work in class to pass the course.</em>
<br>
<br></p>

<h4 id="participation--application-exercises-5">Participation &amp; Application Exercises (5%)</h4>

<p>Application exercises give you an opportunity to practice using the statistical concepts and/or code discussed in lecture on short data analyses. They will typically be started during class and may be assigned to be completed by the next class meeting. In general, these assignments are shorter than homework assignments and will be completed in teams.
<br>
<br></p>

<h4 id="writing-exercises-5">Writing Exercises (5%)</h4>

<p>There will be several writing exercises throughout the semester. Each exercise will include a writing prompt related to the content discussed in class along with peer review. More details will be provided before the first exercise.
<br>
<br></p>

<h4 id="teamwork-5">Teamwork (5%)</h4>

<p>To construct functional and diverse teams, you will be asked to complete a short survey to gauge your previous exposure to programming topics. After completing the survey, you will be assigned to teams of 3-4 students; these teams will stay consistent throughout the semester (barring extraordinary circumstances). You will work in these teams during class, on application exercises, on labs, and on the final project.
<br>
<br></p>

<h4 id="grade-calculation">Grade Calculation</h4>

<p>The final grade will be calculated as follows:</p>

<table class="table table-condensed table-striped table2 text-left">
<thead>
<tr>
<th><span></span></th>
<th><span></span></th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Homework</td>
<td>20%</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Labs</td>
<td>15%</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Exam 1</td>
<td>17.5%</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Exam 2</td>
<td>17.5%</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Final Project</td>
<td>15%</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Participation &amp; Application Exercises</td>
<td>5%</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Writing Exercises</td>
<td>5%</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Teamwork</td>
<td>5%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Class attendance in lecture and lab is a firm expectation; frequent absences or tardiness will be considered a legitimate cause for grade reduction.</p>

<p>If you have a cumulative numerical average of 90 - 100, you are guaranteed at least an A-, 80 - 89 at least a B-, and 70 - 79 at least a C-. The exact ranges for letter grades will be determined after Exam 2.</p>

<!-- ## Policies & Additional Information -->

<h3 id="inclusion--accessibility">Inclusion &amp; Accessibility</h3>

<p>This course is designed to be welcoming and accessible to all students. If there is some aspect of class that is not welcoming or accessible to you, please let me know immediately. Additionally, if you are experiencing something outside of class that is affecting your performance in the course, please feel free to talk with me or your academic dean.</p>

<p>If you have any needs that require accommodation, please let me know as soon as possible and register with the <a href="http://access.duke.edu">Student Disability Access Office (SDAO)</a>.
