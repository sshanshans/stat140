<h3 id="computer-zoom-attendance-and-software">Computer, zoom attendance and software</h3>

<p>You are not required to purchase any books, hardware, or software for this course. While not required, having one’s own laptop (and webcam, if not built-in) is helpful, particularly for in-class activities and office hours.  If you do not have a laptop, please reach out to me at the beginning of the module to discuss possibilities.</p>

<p>Students should ideally be attending the class via zoom with webcam enabled and microphone capability, unless simply not possible, to maximize opportunities for participation. If you do not have stable internet or webcam, please let me know at the beginning of the module.</p>

<p>We will be using the programming language R and <a href="https://rstudio.cloud">RStudio</a>. R is one of the most commonly used programming languages in academic research and industry. Knowing R is a marketable skill. In this class, you will learn enough about R to conduct basic data analysis tasks.</p>

<h3 id="where-to-find-help">Where to find help</h3>

<p>General questions about course content or assignments should be posted on <a href="https://piazza.com/mtholyoke/fall2020/stat14002/home">Piazza</a>, since there are likely other students in the class with similar questions. Questions about grades or personal matters should be emailed directly to Professor Shan Shan.</p>

<p>The teaching team is here to help you be successful in the course. You are encouraged to attend the office hours for help with the course content and/or assignments.</p>

<h3 id="where-to-find-course-materials">Where to find course materials</h3>

<p>All course materials can be found on <a href="https://moodle.mtholyoke.edu/course/view.php?id=19041">Moodle</a>. In particular, all assignments will be distributed, submitted and returned via Moodle.</p>

<h3 id="cultivate-a-community-of-learning">Cultivate a community of learning</h3>

<p>This upcoming semester will be unlike any other in the history of Mount Holyoke. The Covid-19 has caused unprecedented challenges and disruptions in our life, nearby campus or the world. We are engaged in what may be the greatest experiment in the history of higher education. As an instructor, I am grateful to you and your classmates for your flexibility as we transition to new models of teaching, and I am committed to doing my very best to make your learning experience exceptional.</p>

<ul>
<li><h4 id="your-health-and-wellbeing">Your health and well-being</h4>

<p>Part of making sure you have an engaging learning experience involves taking care of yourself, especially during the time of an ongoing pandemic. Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, maintaining a physical distance of 6 feet, washing your hands often, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress. If you are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19, contact your closest health services immediately for help and reach out to me to discuss accommodations for you to take this course. If you experience significant stress or worry, changes in mood, or problems eating or sleeping this semester, whether because of Stat140 or other courses or factors, please do not hesitate to reach out immediately to me to discuss. Everyone can benefit from support during challenging times. Not only are we happy to listen and make accommodations with deadlines as needed, we can also refer you to additional support structures.</p></li>

<li><h4 id="stay-engaged-in-the-course">Stay engaged in the course</h4>

<p>Your active engagement in the course is crucial to your learning.  Here are multiple pathways for you to stay engaged:</p>

<ul>
<li>Asking questions in class and on Piazza: Questions are a normal part of the process of learning.</li>
<li>Answering questions in class and on Piazza: Don't worry if you got the answer wrong. Mistakes are valuable. You learn and improve each time you fix your mistakes.</li>
<li>Coming to Zoom office hours: I will try to make sure everyone in the course can at least attend one office hour every week.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><h4 id="stay-connected-with-each-other">Stay connected with each other</h4>

<p>Mount Holyoke is no common community. We are wired to be caring for others.  Let's all make efforts towards creating a welcoming learning environment for everyone. For example,</p>

<ul>
<li>When doing group projects, consider inviting those locate in a different time zone.</li>
<li>Working towards deadlines can be stressful. Be mindful about how you phrase your questions, comments, inquiries, and suggestions. Also be generous and forgiving when reading them.</li>
<li>I have created a virtual study hall on Gather Town, which is spatial video-calling platform that lets multiple people hold separate conversations in parallel and walk in, out and around those conversations just as easily irl. You can use this space to find others in the course to work together. Link is posted on moodle.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently asked questions</h3>

<p>Q: I'm really interested in taking STAT140, but the class is full and I'm on the waitlist. Can you let me in?</p>

<p>A: Unfortunately, I cannot enlarge the enrollment capacity immediately to let you register for the course. However, the class roster does fluctuate a bit at the beginning of the semester -- some of the students may decide to drop out of the course, in which case spaces may open up for you. Depending on where you are on the waitlist, there might be a chance for you to get enrolled eventually. You are welcome to participate the course during the first few days to see how this course fits your interests and if you will be able to enroll in this course in the end.</p>

<h3 id="rarely-asked-questions">Rarely asked questions</h3>

<p>Q: Why some of my classmates just got the concept/did the programming assignment so fast? Am I not good enough?</p>

<p>A: <strong>No!</strong> Let me say something about peer pressure and impostor syndrome (and this is adapted from Drew Hilton.)</p>

<p>First, your performance in this class is absolute, not relative.  We don't grade on a curve.  It doesn't hurt you for others in the class to do well.  There is a bunch of stuff you need to know, so go learn it.  Learn it well.  Learn it deeply. That takes time.  Focus on your own learning, not what other people are doing.</p>

<p>Second, imposter syndrome is where you feel like it was a mistake that you got admitted/whatever.  You think you aren't good enough, and that eventually someone will figure out this mistake. LOTS of people think this, even [especially?] people who are really good, because they have a high standard. The other thing that makes this worse is the &quot;myth of the effortless genius.&quot;   A lot of social constructs reward/reinforce the idea of looking effortlessly smart  (&quot;oh you are so smart! You did that so easily!&quot;).   We don't say enough &quot;you worked really hard at that, but finally got it---that's what is really important&quot;.   There are only two ways to be effortlessly smart:  (1) doing something that isn't hard enough to challenge you (you have learned the materials before) (2) faking it.</p>

<p>Please remember:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is ok to take a lot of time to master a new concept and learn programming</li>
<li>It is ok for stat140 to be hard</li>
<li>If you have imposter syndrome, it doesn't actually mean you aren't good enough</li>
<li>If you have imposter syndrome, you can come talk to me about it.</li>
<li>We want you to work hard.  It isn't supposed to be easy (if these things were easy, then people wouldn't get paid a lot to do them in jobs!)</li>
