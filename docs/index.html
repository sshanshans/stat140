<h3 id="class-format">Class format</h3>

<p>This course will use the <strong>flipped classroom</strong> model. That means,</p>

<ul>
<li>Before each lecture, you will be learning the content through assigned readings, videos or recorded lectures, and completing a quiz</li>
<li>During the lecture, you will be working on an interactive tutorial in groups to enhance your learning. The purpose of the tutorial is to give you immediate feedback during the process of mastering a new concept or skill set. This portion will be synchronous, online and recorded.</li>
<li>After the lecture, you will be preparing for the next lecture, and occasionally completing an evaluative assignment.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="computer-zoom-attendance-and-software">Computer, zoom attendance and software</h3>

<p>You are not required to purchase any books, hardware, or software for this course. While not required, having one’s own laptop (and webcam, if not built-in) is helpful, particularly for in-class activities and office hours.  If you do not have a laptop, please reach out to me at the beginning of the module to discuss possibilities.</p>

<p>Students should ideally be attending the class via zoom with webcam enabled and microphone capability, unless simply not possible, to maximize opportunities for participation. If you do not have stable internet or webcam, please let me know at the beginning of the module.</p>

<p>We will be using the programming language R and <a href="https://rstudio.cloud">RStudio</a>. R is one of the most commonly used programming languages in academic research and industry. Knowing R is a marketable skill. In this class, you will learn enough about R to conduct basic data analysis tasks.</p>

<h3 id="where-to-find-help">Where to find help</h3>

<p>General questions about course content or assignments should be posted on <a href="https://piazza.com">Piazza</a>, since there are likely other students in the class with similar questions. Questions about grades or personal matters should be emailed directly to Professor Shan Shan.</p>

<p>The teaching team is here to help you be successful in the course. You are encouraged to attend the office hours for help with the course content and/or assignments.</p>

<h3 id="where-to-find-course-materials">Where to find course materials</h3>

<p>All course materials can be found on <a href="https://moodle.mtholyoke.edu/course/view.php?id=19041">Moodle</a>. In particular, all assignments will be distributed, submitted and returned via Moodle.</p>

<h3 id="cultivate-a-community-of-learning">Cultivate a community of learning</h3>

<p>This upcoming semester will be unlike any other in the history of Mount Holyoke. The Covid-19 has caused unprecedented challenges and disruptions in our life, nearby campus or the world. We are engaged in what may be the greatest experiment in the history of higher education. As an instructor, I am grateful to you and your classmates for your flexibility as we transition to new models of teaching, and I am committed to doing my very best to make your learning experience exceptional.</p>

<ul>
<li>#### Your health and well-being
Part of making sure you have an engaging learning experience involves taking care of yourself, especially during the time of an ongoing pandemic. Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, maintaining a physical distance of 6 feet, washing your hands often, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are on campus and experiencing symptoms of COVID-19, contact Health Services immediately for help and reach out to me to discuss accommodations for you to take this course. If you experience significant stress or worry, changes in mood, or problems eating or sleeping this semester, whether because of Stat140 or other courses or factors, please do not hesitate to reach out immediately to me to discuss. Everyone can benefit from support during challenging times. Not only are we happy to listen and make accommodations with deadlines as needed, we can also refer you to additional support structures.</p>

<ul>
<li><h4 id="stay-engaged-in-the-course">Stay engaged in the course</h4>

<p>Your active engagement in the course is crucial to your learning.  Here are multiple pathways for you to stay engaged:</p>

<ul>
<li>Asking questions in class and on Piazza: Questions are a normal part of the process of learning.</li>
<li>Answering questions in class and on Piazza: Don't worry if you got the answer wrong. Mistakes are valuable. You learn and improve each time you fix your mistakes.</li>
<li>Coming to Zoom office hours or open space office hours (if you can): I will try to make sure everyone in the course can at least attend one office hour every week.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><h4 id="stay-connected-with-each-other">Stay connected with each other</h4>

<p>Mount Holyoke is no common community. We are wired to be caring for others.  Let's all make efforts towards creating a welcoming learning environment for everyone. For example,</p>

<ul>
<li>When doing group projects, consider inviting those who won't be able to come to campus or even locate in a different time zone.</li>
<li>Working towards deadlines can be stressful. Remember, emails or online posts do NOT have tones. Be mindful about how you phrase your questions, comments, inquiries, and suggestions. Also be generous and forgiving when reading them.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently asked questions</h3>

<ul>
<li>Q: I'm really interested in taking STAT140, but the class is full and I'm on the waitlist. Can you let me in?</li>
</ul>

<p>A: Unfortunately, I cannot enlarge the enrollment capacity immediately to let you register for the course. However, the class roster does fluctuate a bit at the beginning of the semester -- some of the students may decide to drop out of the course, in which case spaces may open up for you. Depending on where you are on the waitlist, there might be a chance for you to get enrolled eventually. You are welcome to participate the course during the first few days to see how this course fits your interests and if you will be able to enroll in this course in the end.</p>
