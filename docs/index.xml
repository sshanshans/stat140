      <description>Inclusion &amp;amp; Accessibility This course is designed to be welcoming and accessible to all students. It is my goal for our learning environment to facilitate learning and intellectual development for everyone. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, or if there is some aspect of class that is not welcoming or accessible to you, please let me know immediately.
 Academic Accommodations AccessAbility Services is the office on campus that determines academic accommodations for students with disabilities.</description>
