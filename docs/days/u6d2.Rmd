###  CLT based confidence interval

#### Learning objectives 

* To apply the Central Limit Theorem for the mean in practical applications, we must
estimate the standard deviation. This standard error is 
$$ SE(\bar{x}) = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} $$
* When we use the SE, the sampling distribution that allows for the additional uncertainty is Studentâ€™s t.
* Construct confidence intervals for the true mean, $\mu$.
  * A confidence interval for the mean has the form $\bar{x} \pm ME$
  * The Margin of Error is $ME = t* SE(\bar{x})$.
* Write clear summaries to interpret a confidence interval
