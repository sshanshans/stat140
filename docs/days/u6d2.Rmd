###  CLT based confidence interval

#### Learning objectives 

* Use the CLT to make confidence interval for a population mean
* To apply the Central Limit Theorem for the mean in practical applications, we must
estimate the standard deviation. This standard error is 
$$ SE(\bar{x}) = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} $$
* When we use the SE, the sampling distribution that allows for the additional uncertainty is Studentâ€™s t.
* Construct 95% confidence intervals for the true mean $\mu$
  * A confidence interval for the mean has the form $\bar{x} \pm ME$
  * The Margin of Error is $ME = t^* SE(\bar{x})$.
  * $t^*$ is the 0.975th quartile of the $t$ distribution with the degree of freedom equal to $n-1$. 
* Write clear summaries to interpret a confidence interval
