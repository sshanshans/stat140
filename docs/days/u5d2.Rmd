###  Binomial distribution

#### Learning objectives 

* Determine if a random variable is binomial using the four conditions.
    * The trials are independent.
    * The number of trials, n, is fixed.
    * Each trial outcome can be classified as a success or failure.
    * The probability of a success, p, is the same for each trial.
* Calculate the number of possible scenarios for obtaining k successes in n trials using the `choose` function. 
* Calculate probability of a given number of successes in a given number of trials using the binomial distribution
