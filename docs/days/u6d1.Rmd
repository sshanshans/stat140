###  Central limit theorem

#### Learning objectives 

Understand that the Central Limit Theorem is a limit theorem.

* The sampling distribution of the mean is Normal, no matter what the underlying distribution of the data is.
* The CLT says that this happens in the limit, as the sample size grows. The Normal model applies sooner when sampling from a unimodal, symmetric population and more gradually when the population is very non-Normal.


#### Before class
* Finish watching [Introduction to CLT](https://www.coursera.org/learn/inferential-statistics-intro/lecture/lkQnZ/sampling-variability-and-clt) up to 17:16
* Optional [Example](https://www.coursera.org/learn/inferential-statistics-intro/lecture/XhkI6/clt-for-the-mean-examples)
