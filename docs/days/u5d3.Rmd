###  Binomial distribution

#### Learning objectives 

* Define the standardized ($Z$) score of a data point as the number of standard deviations it is away from the mean: $Z=(xâˆ’\mu)/\sigma$
* Use the $Z$ score:
    * if the distribution is normal: to determine the percentile score of a data point (using technology or normal probability tables)
    * regardless of the shape of the distribution: to assess whether or not the particular observation is considered to be unusual (more than 2 standard deviations away from the mean)
* Depending on the shape of the distribution determine whether the median would have a negative, positive, or 0 $Z$ score keeping in mind that the mean always has a Z score of 0.
* Assess whether or not a distribution is nearly normal using the 68-95-99.7% rule or graphical methods such as a normal probability plot.
