### Sampling distribution

#### Learning objectives 
* Define sample statistic as a point estimate for a population parameter, for example, the sample mean is used to estimate the population mean, and note that point estimate and sample statistic are synonymous.

* Recognize that sample statistic (such as the sample mean) will vary from one sample to another, and define this variability as sampling distribution (sometimes also called sampling variation).

#### Before class
