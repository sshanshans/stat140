### Sampling distribution

#### Learning objectives 
* Define sample statistic as a point estimate for a population parameter, for example, the sample mean is used to estimate the population mean, and note that point estimate and sample statistic are synonymous.

* Recognize that sample statistic (such as the sample mean) will vary from one sample to another, and define this variability as sampling distribution (sometimes also called sampling variation).

#### Before class
* Finish watching [sampling variability](https://www.coursera.org/learn/inferential-statistics-intro/lecture/lkQnZ/sampling-variability-and-clt) up to 4:30
* Complete `13 Quiz`: [VPN](http://138.110.84.108:3838/sshan/quiz/Unit4), [nonVPN](http://159.89.233.150:3838/stat140/quiz/Unit4)
