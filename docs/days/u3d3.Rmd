### Model fit and Residuals

#### Learning objectives 
* Always examine the residuals to check for violations of assumptions and conditions and to identify any outliers.
*  Always report and interpret $R^2$, which reports the fraction of the variation of y accounted for by the linear model.
* $R^2$ is the square of the correlation coefficient.
