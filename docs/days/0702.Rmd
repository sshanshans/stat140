###  Inference for regression

#### Learning objectives 

* State and verify whether or not the conditions are met for inference on the slope of the regression line based using the t-distribution.
* Carry out a complete confidence interval procedure for the slope of the regression line.
* Carry out a complete hypothesis test for the slope of the regression line. 
* See how a log transformation can bring symmetry to an extremely skewed variable.
