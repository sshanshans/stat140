###  Comparing two proportions/means

#### Learning objectives 

Know how to construct and interpret confidence intervals for the difference between proportions or means of two independent groups.

* The two-proportion z-interval is appropriate for proportions.
* The two-sample t-interval is appropriate for means.
* The Assumptions and Conditions are the same for both, except that for means, we must also assume that the values in each group follow a Normal model.
