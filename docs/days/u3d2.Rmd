### How useful is your linear model

#### Learning objectives 
* The best fit model is the one that minimizes the sum of the squared residualsâ€”the Least Squares Model.
* Practice using R to find the best fit model
* $R^2$ is the square of the correlation coefficient.
* Always report and interpret $R^2$, which reports the fraction of the variation of y accounted for by the linear model.
