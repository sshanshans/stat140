### Numerical variable: relationship, association and correlation

#### Learning objectives 
* **Make a scatterplot to display the relationship between two quantitative variables.**
  * Look at the direction, form, and strength of the relationship, and any outliers that stand away from the overall pattern.
* **Provided the form of the relationship is straight, summarize its strength with a correlation, r.**
  * The sign of the correlation gives the direction of the relationship.
  * -1 <= r <= 1 ; A correlation of 1 or -1 is a perfect linear relationship. A correlation of 0 indicates that there is no linear relationship.
  * Correlation has no units, so shifting or scaling the data, standardizing, or even swap- ping the variables has no effect on the numerical value.
* **A large correlation is not a sign of a causal relationship.**
