### Introduction to sampling

#### Learning objectives 
* **Know the three ideas of sampling**
    * *Examine a part of the whole*: A sample can give information about the population. 
    * *Randomize* to make the sample representative
    * *The sample size is what matters*: It’s the size of the sample—and not its fraction of the larger population—that determines the precision of the statistics it yields.
* **Understand the advantages and disadvantages of the following sampling methods**
    * *Simple Random Sample (SRS)*: every possible group of n individuals has an equal chance of being our sample.
    * *Stratified samples* can reduce sampling variability by identifying homogeneous subgroups and then randomly sampling within each.
    * *Cluster samples* randomly select among heterogeneous subgroups, making our sampling tasks more manageable.
    * *Multistage samples* combine several random sampling methods. 
* **Identify and avoid causes of bias**
    * *Voluntary response samples* are almost always biased and should be avoided and distrusted.
    * *Convenience samples* are likely to be flawed for similar reasons.
    * *Bad sampling frames* can lead to samples that don’t represent the population of
interest.
    * *Undercoverage* occurs when individuals from a subgroup of the population are selected less often than they should be.
    * *Nonresponse bias* can arise when sampled individuals will not or cannot respond. 
    * *Response bias* arises when respondents’ answers might be affected by external
influences, such as question wording or interviewer behavior.
    * Use best practices when designing a sample survey to improve the chance that your results will be valid.
