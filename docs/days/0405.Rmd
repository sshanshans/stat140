###  Central limit theorem

#### Learning objectives 

Understand that the Central Limit Theorem is a limit theorem.

* The sampling distribution of the mean is Normal, no matter what the underlying distribution of the data is.
* The CLT says that this happens in the limit, as the sample size grows. The Normal model applies sooner when sampling from a unimodal, symmetric population and more gradually when the population is very non-normal.
