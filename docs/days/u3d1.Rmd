### Introduction to linear models

#### Learning objectives 
* Model linear relationships with a linear model.
  * The relationship is straight enough
  * A scatterplot does not 'thicken' in any region
  * There are no outliers
* Interpret a regression slope as y-units per x-unit.
* The intercept, b0, gives a starting value in y-units. Itâ€™s the y-value when x is 0. You can find the intercept from b0 = y - b1x.
