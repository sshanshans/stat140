### Designed experiments and observational studies

#### Learning objectives 
* Recognize observational studies.
* Recognize and know the elements of a designed randomized experiment.
* State and apply the Four Principles of Experimental Design.
    * Control sources of variation other than the factors being tested. Make the condi- tions as similar as possible for all treatment groups except for differences among the treatments.
    * Randomize the assignment of participants to treatments.
    * Replicate by applying each treatment to more than one participant.
    * Block the experiment by grouping together participants who are similar in important ways that you cannot control.
* Work with blinding and control groups.
* Understand the differences between experiments and surveys.
    * Surveys try to estimate facts (parameter) about a population, so they require a representative random sample from that population.
    * Experiments try to estimate the differences in the effects of treatments. They randomize a group of experimental units to treatments, but there is no need for the experimental units to be a representative sample from the population.
* Be alert for possible confounding due to a variable that is not under control affecting the responses differentially.
