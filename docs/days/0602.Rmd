###  P-values

#### Learning objectives 

Understand P-values

* A P-value is the estimated probability of observing a statistic value at least as far from the (null) hypothesized value as the one we have actually observed.
* A small P-value indicates that the statistic we have observed would be unlikely were the null hypothesis true. That leads us to doubt the null.
* A large P-value just tells us that we have insufficient evidence to doubt the null hypothesis. In particular, it does not prove the null to be true.
