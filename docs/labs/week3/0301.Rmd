## 07 Exercise

Adapted from Evan Ray

### Part I: Bike Path Usage

Data were collected on the volume of bicycle path users on the Northampton Rail Trail in Florence, Massachusetts. Variables in the dataset include the number of crossings on a particular day (volume, measured by a sensor near the intersection with Chestnut Street) and the average of the daily low and high temperatures for that day in degrees Fahrenheit (`avgtemp`), among other variables.

The data is pre-loaded for you and called `railtrail`

1.  Make a scatter plot with the volume variable on the vertical axis and the `avgtemp` variable on the horizontal axis.

2.  Describe the shape of the relationship between the `volume` and `avgtemp` variables. Also, discuss whether there are any outliers or gaps.

3.  Would it be appropriate to use the correlation between these variables to summarize the strength and direction of the relationship between these variables?

4.  Calculate the correlation between these variables.

### Part II: Arcade Revenue and Lawyers in Wyoming

Data were collected on the total revenue of arcades in the US (in millions of dollars) and the number of lawyers in Wyoming in each year from 2000 to 2009.

The data is pre-loaded for you, and is named `arcade_lawyers`.

1.  Make a scatter plot with `total_arcade_revenue` on the horizontal axis and `lawyers_in_Wyoming` on the vertical axis.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
2.  Describe the direction, form, and strength of the relationship between arcade revenue and the number of lawyers in Wyoming

3.  Would it be appropriate to summarize the strength and direction of the relationship between these variables with the correlation coefficient?

4.  Calculate the correlation between these variables.

5.  Describe the strength and direction of the relationship between these variables, with reference to the scatter plot and the correlation coefficient (if appropriate).

6.  Do the correlation and relationship that you described above mean that there is a causal relationship between arcade revenue and the number of lawyers in Wyoming?
