## Agenda

1. Reminders: 
    - Review issues on repos with graded work
    - Team feedback 1 due Friday at 11:59p (You received an email from Teammates yesterday. Check your spam if you don't see it.)

2. Lab 06: Modeling course evaluations

3. Getting started with lab

## Lab 06: Modeling course evaluations

- Many college courses give students the opportunity to evaluate the course and the instructor anonymously

- The use of these student evaluations as an indicator of course quality and teaching effectiveness is often criticized because these measures may reflect the influence of non-teaching related characteristics, e.g. the physical appearance of the instructor

## Data comes from...

"Beauty in the classroom: instructorsâ€™ pulchritude and putative pedagogical productivity" 

Daniel S. Hamermesh, Amy Parker, Beauty in the classroom: instructors pulchritude and putative pedagogical productivity, Economics of Education Review, Volume 24, Issue 4, August 2005. http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775704001165

## Some new challenges in this lab

- Dataset is not in your repo, you will need to download it to your computer first and upload it into the appropriate folder in your project (link in the Data section of lab instructions)

- There isn't much code on the lab instructions, you might need to refer to course slides to put the pieces together, however most of the time 
    + you'll be visualizing with **`ggplot`**, 
    + fitting a model with **`lm`**, 
    + and viewing some model statistics with **`glance`**

## Getting started with lab

.small[
- Go to the course GitHub organization and find the **lab-06** repo that has your team name on it.

- On GitHub, click on the green Clone or download button, select Use HTTPS. Click on the clipboard icon to copy the repo URL.

- Go to RStudio Cloud and into the STA199 course workspace. Create a New Project from Git repo. You will need to click on the down arrow next to the New Project button to see this option.

- Copy and paste the URL of your assignment repo into the dialog box and hit OK.

- Run the following in the console to configure Git: 

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(usethis)
use_git_config(user.name="your name", user.email="your email")
```
]

## Caching your password

You need to cache your password on a per-project basis: 

- Go to the **Terminal** within a project (the most recent lab?)
- Type the following to cache your password for $60 * 60 * 24 * 7 = 604800$ seconds

```{bash eval=FALSE}
git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout 604800'
```

You will need to enter your GitHub username and password one more time after caching the password. After that you won't need to enter your credentials for 604800 seconds = 7 days.
