## Lab 07: Course Evaluations, Pt. 2

*Multiple Regression*

- Last time we predicted teacher evaluations scores using only one variable at a time

- What would happen if we included more than one variable in our model? 

---

### The Challenge of Multiple Modeling

- Problems with *collinearity* 

- *Parsimonious* models

```{r echo=F,out.width="30%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/07/tackle.png")
```

example from: 
http://blog.minitab.com/blog/understanding-statistics/handling-multicollinearity-in-regression-analysis

### Some similar challenges in this lab

- Once again, this dataset is not in your repo, you will need to download it to your computer first and upload it into the appropriate folder in your project (link in the Data section of lab instructions)

- There isn't much code on the lab instructions, you might need to refer to course slides to put the pieces together, however most of the time 
    + you'll be visualizing with `ggplot`, 
    + fitting a model with `lm`, 
    + and viewing some model statistics with `glance`

### Getting started with lab

.small[
- Go to the course GitHub organization and find the **lab-07** repo that has your team name on it.

- On GitHub, click on the green Clone or download button, select Use HTTPS. Click on the clipboard icon to copy the repo URL.

- Go to RStudio Cloud and into the STA199 course workspace. Create a New Project from Git repo. You will need to click on the down arrow next to the New Project button to see this option.

- Copy and paste the URL of your assignment repo into the dialog box and hit OK.

- Run the following in the console to configure Git: 

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(usethis)
use_git_config(user.name="your name", user.email="your email")
```
]

- **Use the email address associated with your GitHub account**
---

##Caching passwords

You need to cache your password on a per-project basis: 

- Go to the **Terminal** within a project (the most recent lab?)
- Type the following to cache your password for $60 * 60 * 24 * 7 = 604800$ seconds

```{bash eval=FALSE}
git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout 604800'
```

You will need to enter your GitHub username and password one more time after caching the password. After that you won't need to enter your credentials for 604800 seconds = 7 days.
