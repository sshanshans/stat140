## What is a merge conflict?

---

## Merge conflicts

When two collaborators make changes to a file and push the file to their repo, 
git merges these two files.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width=300, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/02c/merge-no-conflict.png")
```

--

If these two files have conflicting content on the same line, git will produce a <font class="vocab">merge conflict</font>.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width=300, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/02c/merge-conflict.png")
```

---

## Resolving merge conflicts

- Merge conflicts need to be resolved manually, as they require a human intervention

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width=800, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/02c/merge-conflict-identifiers.png")
```

- To resolve the merge conflict
  - decide if you want to keep only your text or the text on GitHub or 
  incorporate changes from both texts
  - delete the conflict markers `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>` and make the 
  changes you want in the final merge

and open the R Markdown file.

- Assign the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 to each of the team members.
    - If you have 3 team members, make one person **Member 2** and **Member 4**.

## Tips for collaborating via GitHub

- Always pull first before you start working.
- Commit, and push, often to minimize merge conflicts and/or to make merge conflicts easier to resolve.
- If you find yourself in a situation that is difficult to resolve, ask questions asap, don't let it linger and get bigger.
