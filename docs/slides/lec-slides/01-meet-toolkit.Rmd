## Agenda

- R and RStudio 
- R Markdown 
- Git and GitHub

## Reproducible data analysis

---

## Reproducibility checklist

.question[
What does it mean for a data analysis to be "reproducible"?
]

--

**Near-term goals:**

- Are the tables and figures reproducible from the code and data?
- Does the code actually do what you think it does?
- In addition to what was done, is it clear **why** it was done? 
(e.g., how were parameter settings chosen?)

--

**Long-term goals:**

- Can the code be used for other data?
- Can you extend the code to do other things?
---

## Toolkit

```{r fig.align="center",out.width="70%",echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/01/toolkit.png")
```


- Scriptability $\rightarrow$ R
- Literate programming (code, narrative, output in one place) $\rightarrow$ R Markdown
- Version control $\rightarrow$ Git / GitHub

# R and RStudio

---

## What is R/RStudio?

- R is a statistical programming language
- RStudio is a convenient interface for R (an integrated development environment, IDE)
- At its simplest:<sup>*</sup>
    - R is like a car’s engine
    - RStudio is like a car’s dashboard

```{r fig.align="center",out.width="70%",echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/01/engine-dashboard.png")
```

## R/RStudio Tour

.center[
[DEMO]
]

Concepts introduced:

- Console
- Using R as a calculator
- Environment
- Loading and viewing a data frame
- Accessing a variable in a data frame
- R functions

---

## R essentials (a short list)

- **Functions** are (most often) verbs, followed by what they will be applied to in parentheses:

```{r eval=FALSE}
do_this(to_this)
do_that(to_this, to_that, with_those)
```

--

- **Columns** (variables) in data frames are accessed with `$`:

```{r eval=FALSE}
dataframe$var_name
```

--

- **Packages** are installed with the `install.packages` function and loaded with the `library` function, once per session:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("package_name")
library(package_name)
```

---

## tidyverse

.pull-left[
![](img/01/tidyverse.png)
]

.pull-right[
.center[
[tidyverse.org](https://www.tidyverse.org/)
]

- The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. 
- All packages share an underlying philosophy and a common grammar.

# R Markdown

---


## R Markdown

- Fully reproducible reports -- the analysis is run from the beginning each time you knit

- Simple Markdown syntax for text

- Code goes in chunks, defined by three backticks, narrative goes outside of chunks

---

## R Markdown Tour

Before we start the tour...

.question[
What is the Bechdel test?
]

--

The Bechdel test asks whether a work of fiction features at least two women who talk to each other about something other than a man, and there must be two women named characters.

--

.center[
[DEMO]
]

--

Concepts introduced:

- Copying a project in RStudio Cloud
- Knitting documents
- R Markdown and (some) R syntax

---

## R Markdown tips

**Resources**
- [R Markdown cheat sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rmarkdown-2.0.pdf)
- Markdown Quick Reference: 
    - `Help -> Markdown Quick Reference`
<br><br>
--


**Remember**: The workspace of the R Markdown document is <u>separate</u> from the console

---

## Workspace vs. console

- Run the following in the console

```{r eval = FALSE}
x <- 2
x * 3
```

--

- Then, add the following chunk in your R Markdown document and knit

```{r eval = FALSE}
x * 3
```

--

.question[
What happens? Why the error?
]

---

## How will we use R Markdown?

- Every assignment / lab / project / etc. is an R Markdown document

- You'll always have a template R Markdown document to start with

- The amount of scaffolding in the template will decrease over the semester

# Git and GitHub

---

## Version control

- We introduced GitHub as a platform for collaboration

- But it's much more than that...

- It's actually designed for version control

---

## Versioning

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/01/lego-steps.png")
```

---

## Versioning 

with human readable messages

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/01/lego-steps-commit-messages.png")
```

---

### Why do we need version control?

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/01/phd_comics_vc.gif")
```

---

## Git and GitHub tips

- **Git** is a version control system -- like “Track Changes” features from Microsoft Word. 

--

- **GitHub** is the home for your Git-based projects on the internet (like DropBox but much better).

--

- There are a lot of Git commands and very few people know them all. 99% of the time you will use git to add, commit, push, and pull.

---

## Git and GitHub tips

- We will be doing git things and interfacing with GitHub through RStudio
    - If you Google for help you might come across methods for doing these things in the command line -- skip that and move on to the next resource unless you feel comfortable trying it out.

--

- There is a great resource for working with git and R: [happygitwithr.com](http://happygitwithr.com/).
    - Some of the content in there is beyond the scope of this course, but it's a good place to look for help.

---

## Git and GitHub Tour

.center[
[DEMO]
]

- Concepts introduced:
  - Connect an R project to GitHub repository
  - Working with a local and remote repository
  - Making a change locally, committing, and pushing
  - Making a change on GitHub and pulling
  
- There is just a bit more of GitHub that we'll use in this class, but this is enough for today.

---

## Recap 

Can you answer these questions? 

- What is a reproducible data analysis, and why is it important?
- What is version control, and why is it important?
- What is R vs. RStudio? 
- What is git vs. GitHub? 

---

## Before next class
