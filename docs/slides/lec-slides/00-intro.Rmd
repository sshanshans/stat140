## What is Data Science?

*"Data science is a concept to unify statistics, data analysis, machine learning and their related methods in order to understand and analyze actual phenomena with data. It employs techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of <font class="vocab">mathematics, statistics, information science, and computer science</font>."*

## Your Turn!

---

## Create a GitHub account

<small>

.instructions[
Go to https://github.com/, and create an account (unless you already have one)
]

Tips for creating a username from [Happy Git with R](http://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html#username-advice).

- Incorporate your actual name!
- Reuse your username from other contexts if you can, e.g., Twitter or Slack.
- Pick a username you will be comfortable revealing to your future boss.
- Shorter is better than longer.
- Be as unique as possible in as few characters as possible.
- Make it timeless. Don’t highlight your current university, employer, or place of residence.
- Avoid words laden with special meaning in programming, like `NA`.

## Join RStudio.cloud 

- Go to [http://bit.ly/sta199-sp19-rstudio](http://bit.ly/sta199-sp19-rstudio), and log in with your GitHub credentials.

- You should see a project called *UN Votes*. Click "Copy"; this will create your copy of the project and launch it.

]

---

## UN Votes Analysis

- In the Files pane in the bottom right corner, spot the file called `00-unvotes.Rmd`. Open it, and then click on the "Knit" button.
- Go back to the file and put your name in the author field at the top of the file (in the  `yaml` -- we will discuss what this is at a later date). Knit again.
- Change the country names in parts 1 and 2 to countries that interest you. The spelling and capitalization must match what's in the data, so you can use the [Appendix](#appendix) to see the correct spelling and capitalization. Knit again.

You have made your first data visualization!

## Discussion 

Discuss the following with a partner.

1. Consider the plot in Part 1. Describe how the voting behaviors of the four countries have changed over time.

2. Consider the plot in Part 2. 
    - On which issues have the two countries voted most similarly in recent years?  
    - On which issues have they voted most differently in recent years? 
    - Has this changed over time?

</small>

---

## Excused Absences

- Students who miss a class due to a scheduled varsity trip, religious holiday, or short-term illness should fill out the respective form.
     - These excused absences do not excuse you from assigned work. 
--
- If you have a personal or family emergency or chronic health condition that affects your ability to participate in class, please contact your academic dean’s office.
--

- Exam dates cannot be changed and no make-up exams will be given. 

---

## Late Work &amp; Regrade Requests

- Homework assignments: 
    - Late but within 24 hours of deadline: 20% penalty
    - Not accepted if submitted any later
    
- Late work will not be accepted for the take-home exams or final project. 

- Regrade requests must be submitted within three days of when the assignment is returned using the link posted in the course syllabus

---

## Academic Honesty

All work for this class should be done in accordance with the Duke Community Standard. 

> To uphold the Duke Community Standard:
> - I will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;
> - I will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors; and
> - I will act if the Standard is compromised.

Any violations will automatically result in a grade of 0 on the assignment and will be reported to [Office of Student Conduct](https://studentaffairs.duke.edu/conduct) for further action.

---

## Reusing Code

- Unless explicitly stated otherwise, you may make use of online resources (e.g. StackOverflow) for coding examples on assignments. If you directly use code from an outside source (or use it as inspiration), you must or explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.

- On individual assignments, you may discuss the assignment with one another; however, you may not directly share code or write up with other students. 

- On team assignments, you may not directly share code or write up with another team. Unauthorized sharing of the code or write up will be considered a violation for all students involved. 

---

## Where to find help

- I encourage you to attend office hours! It is often easier to discuss the course content in-person than online.

- Use Piazza for general questions about course content and/or assignments, since other students may benefit from the response.

- Use email for questions regarding personal matters and/or grades.

---

## Technology 

- You should bring a laptop to every lecture and lab session.  Outlets are limited, so make sure it is fully-charged.

- Ensure the volume on all devices is set to mute.

- Refrain from engaging in activities not related to the class discussion. Browsing the web and social media, excessive messaging, playing games, etc. is not only a distraction for you but is also a distraction for everyone around you.

---

## Inclusion & Accessibility

This course is designed to be welcoming and accessible to all students. If there is some aspect of class that is not welcoming or accessible to you, please let me know immediately. Additionally, if you are experiencing something outside of class that is affecting your performance in the course, please feel free to talk with me or your academic dean.
