### Alternate ways to evaluate evidence

- Concentrate on effect sizes
    - How big of a difference does an intervention make
    - Is it practically meaningful?

- Use confidence intervals to estimate effect size

- Ask whether the result is from a novel study or a replication (put some more weight into a theory many labs have looked into)

- Ask whether underlying data is freely accessible (so anyone can check the math)

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

---

### Alternate ways to evaluate evidence

- Use alternative statistical techniques like likelihood ratios and Bayes factors
    - P-values ask the question ‚Äúhow rare are my results?‚Äù 
    - Likelihood ratios and Bayes factors ask the question ‚Äúwhat is the probability my hypothesis is the best explanation for the results we found?‚Äù 
    
- You'll learn more about these in future statistics classes üòÑ

## Privacy

---

## OK Cupid Data Breach

- In 2016, researchers published data of 70,000 OkCupid users‚Äîincluding usernames, political leanings, drug usage, and intimate sexual details.

&gt;"Some may object to the ethics of gathering and releasing this data. However, all the data found in the dataset are or were already publicly available, so releasing this dataset merely presents it in a more useful form.""

&gt; Researchers Emil Kirkegaard and Julius Daugbjerg Bjerrek√¶r

- Although the researchers did not release the real names and pictures of the OkCupid users, critics noted that their identities could easily be uncovered from the details provided‚Äîsuch as from the usernames.

## Machine Bias

There‚Äôs software used across the country to predict future criminals. And it's biased...

&gt;‚ÄúAlthough these measures were crafted with the best of intentions, I am concerned that they inadvertently undermine our efforts to ensure individualized and equal justice,‚Äù he said, adding, ‚Äúthey may exacerbate unwarranted and unjust disparities that are already far too common in our criminal justice system and in our society.‚Äù

## ProPublica analysis

**Data:** Risk scores assigned to more than 7,000 people arrested in Broward County, Florida, in 2013 and 2014 + whether they were charged with new crimes over the next two years

--
  
**Results:** 

- 20% of those predicted to commit violent crimes actually did

- Algorithm had higher accuracy (61%) when full range of crimes taken into account (e.g. misdemeanors)

![](img/14a/propublica-results.png)

- Algorithm was more likely to falsely flag African American defendants as future criminals, at almost twice the rate as Caucasian defendants

### Amazon's Experimental Hiring Algorithm

- Amazon used AI to give job candidates scores ranging from one to five stars - much like shoppers rate products on Amazon, some of the people said

- Company realized its new system was not rating candidates for software developer jobs and other technical posts in a gender-neutral way

- Amazon‚Äôs system taught itself that male candidates were preferable

&gt;"Gender bias was not the only issue. Problems with the data that underpinned the models‚Äô judgments meant that unqualified candidates were often recommended for all manner of jobs, the people said."

## Review

.question[
A company uses a machine learning algorithm to determine which job advertisement to display for users searching for technology jobs. Based on past results, the algorithm tends to display lower paying jobs for women than for men (after controlling for other characteristics).

What ethical considerations might be considered when reviewing this algorithm?

## Parting thoughts

- At some point during your data science journey you will learn tools that can be used unethically

- You might also be tempted to use your knowledge in a way that is ethically questionable either because of business goals or for the pursuit of further knowledge (or because your boss told you to do so)

.question[
How do you train yourself to make the right decisions (or reduce the likelihood of accidentally making the wrong decisions) at those points?
